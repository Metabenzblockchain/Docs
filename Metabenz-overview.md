# METABENZ Network overview

## What is the METABENZ Network?

METABENZ Network is a permissionless and border-less public ledger designed for easy integration of everyday payments. It's anchored to Ethereum using a bridge which allows any token to freely move between Ethereum and the METABENZ Network. A Token is minted on Ethereum and then moved to the METABENZ Network, where it gets access to a wide range of features and business plugins that brings it to life.

User data in the METABENZ Network network is stored by the users on their devices and they decide who to share it with using standard web3.0 interfaces. The users can join communities and community contracts define their data and governance policies. Those communities can be governed by individuals or organizations, everything is public and transparent on the blockchain.

METABENZ Network Studio allows users to easily launch and operate new communities, with a built-in contract store that enables easy launch of new features and integrated services - fiat on-ramps, business management plugins, community management functionality and much more.
