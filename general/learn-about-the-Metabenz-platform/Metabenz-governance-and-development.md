# METABENZ Blockchain Governance and Development

METABENZ Network Network is already a significantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **METABENZ Network Network Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the METABENZ Network Network treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis.

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, maintains the full node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on METABENZ Network Network. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the METABENZ Network Network tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.
