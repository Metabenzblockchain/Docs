# Boosting METABENZ Blockchain's Scalability

METABENZ addresses scalability challenges by integrating an innovative Layer 1 (L1) Blockchain protocol utilizing a unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model within its distributed ledger system.&#x20;

The DAG model, operating on a cyclical basis, enhances scalability as the Network grows. It incorporates sharding, partitioning the validator set into smaller groups called shards. Each shard's validators process transactions for specific accounts and update the ledger accordingly. Further details on the validation process can be found in the subsequent sections.&#x20;

In this framework, the state—including account and transaction records, transaction processing, and consensus achievement (if required)—is distributed across multiple nodes. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for global consensus, as each shard operates independently.

&#x20;While Ethereum has successfully implemented this model, METABENZ improves it by introducing an updated fork of Ethereum. This integration allows METABENZ to leverage the advantages of this approach. As more independent validators are METABENZ WHITEPAPER 2 3 23 gradually deployed to the METABENZ Blockchain, the Network's security and decentralization will be further enhanced
