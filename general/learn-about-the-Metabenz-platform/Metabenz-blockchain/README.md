# The METABENZ Blockchain

## Network Overview and Key Metrics

METABENZ Network  is the decentralized EVM-compatible public blockchain that powers the METABENZ Network Network platform and ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of METABENZ Network .

The METABENZ Blockchain uses a variant of  Proof of Distribution (POD) for achieving the consensus is secured by a significant number of independent validators, only one of which is run by the METABENZ Network core team.

Validators are also responsible for the most important type of governance on METABENZ Network , namely, adopting the network protocol changes.

The native network of the network is called METABENZ . New METABENZ Network are issued with every added block and are also use to pay for gas, just like ETH on Ethereum.

The METABENZ Network blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on METABENZ Network  is around 5 seconds, and it currently costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

In its present capacity, the METABENZ Network  blockchain is capable of processing around 120 native network transfers and 60 METABENZ Network network transfers per second. The faster processing of native network transfers is due to the fact that they do not involve computations run on the network's virtual machine.
