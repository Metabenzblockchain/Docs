# METABENZ  Network (METABENZ)

The METABENZ Network  is the native currency of the METABENZ Network  and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## METABENZ Network utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the METABENZ Network , METABENZ Network is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake METABENZ  Network to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 50K. The network is growing, currently there are 2 validators.
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked METABENZ Network. Which means validators with higher amounts of METABENZ  Network staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any METABENZ Network holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of METABENZ Network they wish. They receive a share of the METABENZ Network Network block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 10% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As METABENZ Network is the native currency on METABENZ Network , sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, METABENZ Network transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of METABENZ Networks does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the METABENZ Network platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
