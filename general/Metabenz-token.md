# METABENZ Blockchain Token

METABENZ Blockchain token is required to be paid to the network to approve transactions. The METABENZ Blockchain network is using the token to create circulation between users that look to validate transactions on the network and validators who invest computing resources and maintain it. Every block created on the METABENZ Blockchain chain is creating new METABENZ Blockchain tokens rewarded to the validators. This creates a 15% yearly inflation rate of METABENZ Blockchain tokens in circulation.

METABENZ Blockchain holders can lock it and delegate it to a validator in order to protect against inflation and get rewarded with METABENZ Blockchain tokens. The holders can select their favorite validator and validators are selected based on having the most METABENZ Blockchain tokens staked.

The native METABENZ Blockchain token is represented via an ERC-20 token on Ethereum mainnet,BEP-20 token on BSC and can be moved between the METABENZ Blockchain chain, BSC and Ethereum using the bridge.

## METABENZ Blockchain token utility:

* **Validation** Token holders can stake METABENZ Blockchain to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 50K. The network is growing, currently there are 100+ validators.
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked METABENZ Blockchain. Which means validators with higher amounts of METABENZ Blockchain staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Fees** The METABENZ Blockchain token is the native currency on the METABENZ Blockchain blockchain and is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Delegation - Activated Q3 2020** Delegation for token holders will be activated. This will allow any METABENZ Blockchain token holder to delegate their tokens to a validator to earn rewards. Validators compete between themselves to receive METABENZ Blockchain delegated from token holders. Validators with the most METABENZ Blockchain tokens are elected to validate on METABENZ Blockchain.

## **Inflation**

* 15% inflation in the network is distributed between the validators. Each cycle (A cycle is all transactions conducted in 48 hours) the validators with the highest amount of METABENZ Blockchain tokens staked will split the rewards based on their stake.
* A fixed inflation rate also helps with stabilization of the token price. At phase 2 of the network an upgrade to a differential inflation schedule will be proposed and voted on by the validators to optimize the inflation/fee price policy.
* Large users on METABENZ Blockchain can participate more closely in the governance and the operation of the network and plan ahead so instead of having high operation costs, they can become a stakeholder and benefit from the networkâ€™s growth.

## **Fees**

* The network charges fees on every transaction that goes to the validators and is capped 0.015 MBC per transaction.
* While the network has unfilled blocks the cost per transaction will be lower than 1 cent.
* The fee cost per transaction in METABENZ Blockchain will be adjusted to be a maximum of 1 cent US dollar once the blocks start to fill up. At this stage simple transfer transactions will be moved off-chain.
