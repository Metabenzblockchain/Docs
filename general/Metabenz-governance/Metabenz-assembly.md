# METABENZ Network Network Assembly

METABENZ Network Network Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the METABENZ Network Network community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the METABENZ Network Network platform to the community.

Currently, METABENZ Network Network Assembly consists of five METABENZ Network Network ecosystem members independent from METABENZ Network Network Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

METABENZ Network Network Assembly's **current role includes the following**:

- taking over the control over the [METABENZ Network Network Forum](https://forum.metabenz.com/) community discussion platform;
- implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on METABENZ Network Network; and
- managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

METABENZ Network Network Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 METABENZ Network** will be allocated to it from the METABENZ Network Network Bootstrap Pool \(discussed [here](https://doc.metabenz.com/general/METABENZ Network-token/METABENZ Network-supply-and-current-distribution)\).

METABENZ Network Network Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation.
