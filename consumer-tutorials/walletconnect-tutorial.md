# How to use WalletConnect on METABENZ and add liquidity on METABENZ

**Step 1:**

Open your METABENZ Blockchain cash wallet on your phone and the interface shown will be similar to the one shown in the image below.

Use the “Connect to a wallet” on the right hand top corner and select “WalletConnect”. Now the website will display a QR code.



You can also see your share of the liquidity pool based on the amount of METABENZ you want to provide liquidity for.

Click on “Approve MBC” and confirm the transaction through your wallet.

(Note: If this is the first time you are providing liquidity on METABENZ using the above pairs you will have to approve the spend transaction.)

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, click on “Supply” and approve the transaction. You will receive the liquidity pool tokens on your wallet which can be checked under tokens through https://[.metabenzscan.com](http://www.metabenz.com/) on your wallet address.

Navigating to **“Pool”** on METABENZ will also show you list of token pairs with statistics for which you have provided liquidity and other options like add/remove liquidity for that particular token pair as shown below.
